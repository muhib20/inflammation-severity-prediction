## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project contains quantitative histological features extracted from tissue samples and corresponding inflammation severity scores assigned by expert pathologists.

Due to data usage restrictions, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

Researchers interested in reproducing the experiments should replace the dataset loading section in the notebooks with their own compatible data source following the same structure:
- PatID (patient identifier)
- Severity Score (0–5)
- Numerical feature columns
